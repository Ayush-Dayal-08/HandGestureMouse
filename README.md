Hand Gesture Mouse Control - Windows Application
================================================

Control your computer mouse using only your hand movements, powered by AI-based
hand tracking. This application uses your webcam to detect finger gestures and 
translates them into mouse actions like movement, clicking, and scrolling.

🔍 PROJECT OVERVIEW
------------------------------------------------
This gesture-based mouse controller is built using:
• MediaPipe for real-time hand landmark detection
• OpenCV for image capture and processing
• Tkinter for GUI controls
• PyAutoGUI for simulating mouse actions
• PyArmor for protecting code and verifying license keys

The program is compiled to an executable file for ease of use and protected
against unauthorized copying or use.

🧠 KEY FEATURES

✅ Hand Tracking via Webcam  
✅ Real-time Cursor Movement using Index Finger  
✅ Left Click using Thumb + Pinky Tap Gesture  
✅ Smooth Scrolling by Two-Finger Up Gesture  
✅ GUI Control Panel to Start, Stop, and Exit  
✅ Advanced Smoothing Algorithms for Stability  
✅ License Key Verification via Google Sheet  
✅ Tamper Detection — Application fails silently if modified  
✅ Obfuscated and Compiled for Secure Use
